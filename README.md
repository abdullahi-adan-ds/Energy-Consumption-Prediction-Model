# Energy Prediction Model

A machine learning project to predict energy consumption using Random Forest regression. This repository showcases data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation, built during a data science bootcamp.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Predict energy consumption based on features like load, time, and TX power.
- **Dataset**: Energy consumption data with 81,228 entries and 6 features.
- **Methods**: Data cleaning, one-hot encoding, Random Forest regression, and evaluation with RMSE, MSE, and R² metrics.
- **Key Results**: Achieved RMSE of 4.88 and R² of 0.82, indicating strong predictive performance.
