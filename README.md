# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-Model  

A supervised learning project predicting energy consumption using **Random Forest regression**.  
Built with Python, pandas, and scikit-learn.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation ‚Äî completed during a data science bootcamp.  

---

## üìå Project Overview  
- **Goal:** Predict energy consumption based on features like load, time, and TX power.  
- **Dataset:** 81,228 entries √ó 6 features (energy consumption data).  
- **Methods:** Data cleaning, one-hot encoding, Random Forest regression, and evaluation with RMSE, MSE, and R¬≤ metrics.  
- **Key Results:** Achieved **RMSE = 4.88** and **R¬≤ = 0.82**, indicating strong predictive performance.
